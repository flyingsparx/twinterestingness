    <h1>Welcome to Twinterestingness</h1>
    <p>Twinterestingness is an experiment by <a href="http://cs.cardiff.ac.uk" target="_blank">Cardiff School of Computer Science &amp; Informatics</a> from <a href="http://cardifff.ac.uk">Cardiff University</a>.</p>

    <h2>The experiment</h2>
    <p>The idea of the experiment is to get an idea of the content that <i> you</i> find interesting from the users that you follow. Thus, to take part in the experiment, you need to have a <a href="https://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account and be following at least 10 users.</p>
    <p>If you take part in the experiment, you will be asked a series of questions in which we ask you to rate the Tweets from your Twitter friends based on how <i>interesting</i> you find them. We'll tell you more about it before you start the experiment.</p>
