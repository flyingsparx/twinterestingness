<h1>Cookie policy</h1>
<p>On this page we outline our use of cookies on this website.</p>
<h2>What are cookies?</h2>
<p>Cookies are small, temporary pieces of information that are stored within your web browser on your own computer. Generally, they are used by websites to keep track of where users are as they navigate through the site.</p>
<p>For example, a shopping website might use cookies to identify you as the same user as you add more items to your shopping basket. Without using cookies, the site would not be able to know who you are, and so could associate you with the wrong basket.</p>

<h2>What we use cookies for</h2>
<p>We store information in your browser so that we can identify which user has signed in through Twitter, to minimise the number of API calls we have to make to Twitter on your behalf and thus improve the efficiency of the website.</p>
